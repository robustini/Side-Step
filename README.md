**Standalone training toolkit for ACE-Step 1.5 audio generation models.**
Takes you from raw audio files to a working adapter without the friction. Variant-aware multi-adapter fine-tuning (LoRA, DoRA, LoKR, LoHA, OFT) with auto-detection, low-VRAM support, and three ways to work.

> **Status:** v1.0.0-beta -- Stable enough for daily use. Some features are still experimental. This is beta software being maintained by one person only; if you encounter an issue, please let me know in the issues tab.

## Why Side-Step?

Side-Step auto-detects your model variant (turbo, base, or sft), selects the scientifically correct training schedule, and runs on consumer hardware down to 8 GB VRAM. Version 1.0.0 evolves it from a training script into a complete standalone software suite.

### What was already here

- **Auto-Configured Training** -- Turbo gets discrete 8-step sampling. Base/SFT gets continuous logit-normal + CFG dropout. The upstream trainer forces the Turbo schedule on all models; Side-Step fixes this automatically.
- **LoRA + LoKR Adapters** -- Standard and Kronecker-product low-rank fine-tuning.
- **Preprocessing++ (PP++)** -- Fisher Information analysis assigns adaptive per-module ranks based on how important each layer is to *your specific audio*. Writes a `fisher_map.json` that training auto-detects.
- **Two-Pass Preprocessing** -- Converts raw audio to training tensors in two low-memory passes (~3 GB then ~6 GB).
- **Interactive Wizard** -- Step-by-step prompts with "Go Back" support, presets, flow chaining, and session carry-over defaults.
- **Dataset Builder** -- Point at a folder of audio + sidecar `.txt` files and get a `dataset.json` automatically.
- **Low VRAM** -- 8-bit optimizers, gradient checkpointing, encoder offloading. Trains down to ~10 GB.
- **Standalone & Portable** -- Installs as its own project via `uv`. No need to touch your ACE-Step installation.

### New in 1.0.0

- **Full Electron GUI** -- Desktop application with Ez Mode (3-click training), Advanced Mode (every knob), real-time Monitor (loss charts, GPU stats), and a Lab workspace (datasets, preprocessing, PP++, export). CRT shader with phosphor bloom, scanlines, and chromatic aberration. Themeable (4 built-in themes + full editor).
- **DoRA, LoHA, OFT Adapters** -- Three additional adapter architectures alongside LoRA and LoKR.
- **ComfyUI Export** -- Convert PEFT LoRA/DoRA adapters to the single-file `.safetensors` format ComfyUI expects. LyCORIS adapters (LoKR, LoHA) are already natively compatible.
- **AI Captioning** -- Generate sidecar metadata with **local AI** (Qwen2.5-Omni, no API key, runs on your GPU), Google Gemini, OpenAI, or lyrics scraped from Genius.
- **Offline Audio Analysis** -- BPM, key, and time signature extraction via `demucs` stem separation + `librosa`. No API keys required.
- **Built-in Music Player** -- Play dataset audio directly in the GUI. Marquee display, EQ visualizer, volume control, auto-play, dockable bar.
- **Live VRAM Estimation** -- Segmented bar shows model + activation + optimizer breakdown before you start training. Changes reactively as you adjust settings.
- **VRAM Presets** -- One-click profiles: 8 GB, 12 GB, 16 GB, 24 GB+, Quick Test, High Quality, Recommended.
- **Run History** -- Persistent log of past training runs with best loss, adapter path, and hyperparameters.
- **Tag Management** -- Bulk add/remove trigger tags and convert legacy sidecar formats.
- **Cross-Platform Entry Point** -- `sidestep` (or `uv run sidestep` if not on PATH) works on all platforms.

## The Three Ways to Use Side-Step

> The experimental TUI from 0.9.0 and before has been deprecated. The interactive Wizard is its definitive replacement.

### 1. The Desktop Window (GUI)

Visual training, dataset management, live charts, and CRT-classic aesthetics (if you manage to find it :3).

```bash
uv run sidestep gui
```

**Modes:** Ez Mode | Advanced | Monitor | Lab (History, Tensor Datasets, Audio Library, Preprocess, PP++, Export)

![Ez Mode](assets/Screenshots/Side-Step%20EZ%20Mode.png)
![Advanced Mode](assets/Screenshots/Side-Step%20Advanced%20Mode.png)
![Audio Library](assets/Screenshots/Side-Step%20Audio%20Library.png)

### 2. The Interactive Wizard

Terminal prompts with back-navigation, presets, and flow chaining (preprocess -> train, PP++ -> train, build dataset -> preprocess -> train).

```bash
uv run sidestep
```

![Wizard](assets/Screenshots/Side-Step%20Wizard%20Main.png)

### 3. The Command Line (CLI)

Automate pipelines or bypass menus entirely. Every argument has a `(default: X)` in `--help`.

```bash
uv run sidestep train \
    --checkpoint-dir ./checkpoints \
    --model-variant turbo \
    --dataset-dir ./my_tensors \
    --output-dir ./output/my_lora \
    --adapter-type dora \
    --rank 64 --alpha 128 \
    --epochs 500
```

---

## Quick Install

### Linux / macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/koda-dernet/Side-Step.git
cd Side-Step
chmod +x install_linux.sh && ./install_linux.sh
```

### Windows
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/koda-dernet/Side-Step.git
cd Side-Step
.\install_windows.ps1
```

The installer handles Python 3.11, PyTorch, Electron, and all dependencies via `uv`. Flash Attention is pulled from pre-built wheels -- no 20-minute (or more) local compilation.

### Get Models

You need the ACE-Step 1.5 checkpoints. If you don't have them:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step-1.5.git
cd ACE-Step-1.5 && uv sync && uv run acestep-download
```

## VRAM Profiles

Side-Step runs on everything from an RTX 3060 to an H100. Built-in presets configure these automatically.

| Profile | VRAM | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Comfortable** | 24 GB+ | AdamW, Batch 2+, Rank 128 |
| **Standard** | 16-24 GB | AdamW, Batch 1, Rank 64 |
| **Tight** | 12-16 GB | AdamW8bit, Encoder offloading |
| **Minimal** | 8-10 GB | AdamW8bit, Offloading, Grad accumulation 8, Rank 16 |

Gradient checkpointing is **on by default**, reducing baseline VRAM to ~7 GB before optimizer state.

---

## Workflows

### Preprocessing

Convert raw audio into training tensors. Two-pass approach keeps peak VRAM low.

```bash
uv run sidestep preprocess \
    --audio-dir ./my_songs \
    --tensor-output ./my_tensors \
    --normalize peak
```

### Training

Train an adapter on preprocessed tensors. Side-Step detects your variant and applies the correct schedule.

```bash
uv run sidestep train \
    --checkpoint-dir ./checkpoints \
    --model-variant turbo \
    --dataset-dir ./my_tensors \
    --output-dir ./output/my_lora \
    --epochs 500
```

### Preprocessing++ (Adaptive Ranks)

Find which layers matter most for your data, then allocate rank accordingly.

```bash
uv run sidestep analyze \
    --checkpoint-dir ./checkpoints \
    --model-variant turbo \
    --dataset-dir ./my_tensors
```

Writes `fisher_map.json` into the dataset folder. Training auto-detects it and applies variable ranks.

### AI Captioning

Generate rich sidecar metadata for your audio files.

```bash
uv run sidestep captions \
    --audio-dir ./my_songs \
    --provider local_16gb       # or gemini, openai, lyrics_only
```

### Export to ComfyUI

```bash
uv run sidestep export \
    --adapter-dir ./output/my_lora/final \
    --target native
```

### Dataset Building

```bash
uv run sidestep dataset --input ./my_music_folder
```

## Technical Notes: Timestep Sampling

Side-Step ensures your fine-tuning matches the base model's original training distribution:

1. **Turbo models** -- Discrete 8-step sampling (matching inference).
2. **Base/SFT models** -- Continuous logit-normal sampling + CFG dropout (matching training).

The upstream trainer often forces the Turbo schedule on all models, which is incorrect for Base/SFT. Side-Step detects and fixes this automatically.
